# Emacs-for-Writing
This repository will, eventually, hold my configuration file for Emacs.  This configuration will focus on setting up Emacs for writing notes, memoranda, research papers, essays, blogs, journals, and other long form writings.  This configuration is meant for non-programmers, and will likely be mostly, if not entirely, centered around Org Mode.
